# Check for tickets v1.0.0

The idea behind this project is to set an automated process to check if your event is available for sell in an specific tickets-sale platform. In case tickets are available you'll be noticed via SMS. Also the idea is to have it working as soon as possible, so there are a LOT of things that can and must (and maybe will) be done better and/or secure. You are warned and must use this project at your own risk without any responsibility of the contributors to the project.

## Pre-requisites

You must have a Twilio account for this app to work. If you donÂ´t have one, at the _How to use it_ section you'll find a link to create one for free. Also this app is meant to run in your own old laptop.

## How to use it

1 - Create your twilio account following instruction at this [link](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
2 - After creating your account edit `template.CONFIG.js` file with the data from your twilio account.
3 - Rename `template.CONFIG.js` to `CONFIG.js`. Remember to keep this file ignored at `.gitignore` to keep your credentials secure.
4 - In terminal execute `npm run start`. Done.
